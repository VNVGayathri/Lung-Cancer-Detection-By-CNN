This project focuses on detecting lung cancer using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The dataset containing patient details such as age, smoking level, alcohol intake, and air quality was used to train the model. After data preprocessing and normalization, the CNN was trained to classify patients as cancerous or non-cancerous. The model achieved high accuracy in predicting lung cancer presence. Finally, it successfully identified cases by printing interpretable results such as “Lung cancer detected (cancerous tissue identified)” or “No signs of lung cancer (non-cancerous tissue).”
